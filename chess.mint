 
;Here is a program in Mint that will check the next move for 8 chess pawns. 
;This program assumes that the pawns are stored in an array called PAWNS, 
;with each element of the array representing the position of a pawn on the chessboard. 
;The program will print out the next possible position for each pawn.
;To use this program, you will need to replace PAWNS with the address of the array that stores the positions of the pawns. 
;The CHECK_PAWN command will check the next possible position for a single pawn, 
;and the MAIN command will loop through the CHECK_PAWN command for each pawn in the array.

 
:CHECK_PAWN   \[   1 +   \[  0  1  ]   \@ PAWNS   \> \i
  0 =   \[  0 -1  ]   \@ PAWNS   \> \i
  \]   \i   ;

:MAIN   \[  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  ]   CHECK_PAWN   ;
 


To modify the program to move a pawn to the next best position or take an opposing piece sideways, 
you can add an additional command that will determine the best move for the pawn based on the current board state.
In this modified version of the program, the GET_BEST_MOVE command determines the best move for a single pawn based on the positions of the pawns and the opposing pieces. The MOVE_PAWN command updates the position of the pawn in the PAWNS array and removes the opposing piece from the OPPONENTS array (if applicable). The MAIN command loops through the MOVE_PAWN command for each pawn in the PAWNS array.

You will need to replace PAWNS and OPPONENTS with the addresses of the arrays that store the positions of the pawns 
and opposing pieces, respectively. 
You may also need to adjust the code to match the specific rules of the game of chess that you are implementing.

:GET_BEST_MOVE   \[   \[  0  1  ]   \@ PAWNS   \> \i   \[  0  1  ]   \@ OPPONENTS   \> \j   \[  0 -1  ]   \@ OPPONENTS   \> \k  
  1 +   \i   \> \i   1 +   \j   \> \j   1 +   \k   \> \k  
  \i   \j   =   \k   \j   =   \i   \k   =   \[  0  0  ]   \i   \j   \k   \> \i  
  \]   \i   ;

:MOVE_PAWN   \[   GET_BEST_MOVE   \@ PAWNS   \> \i   \@ OPPONENTS   \> \j  \i   \j   +   \> PAWNS   \> OPPONENTS    \]   ;

:MAIN   \[  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  ]   MOVE_PAWN   ;
